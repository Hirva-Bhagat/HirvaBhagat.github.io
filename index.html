                                    <li><span class="importo">The human eye is the most interactive organ in their body. A personâ€™s eye movements along with
the photometric characteristics provide vital information about them. They are also a source for
learning essential visual information. In computer vision, eye information is used in fields like
detection and recognition of face. In driver safety research, eye information is utilized in the
fields of computer vision for driver distraction detection, gauging driver attention and driver gaze
estimation. Driver gaze estimation relates to determining where the driver is looking. It helps us to
relate driver behavior and behavior of the road objects. The setting of driver gaze estimation uses
the face or front view of the driver to collect important information. This information is further
processed to get the R3 angle of where the driver is looking. Driver gaze estimation mainly relies
on two methodologies: Appearance based methods and model based methods.
                                    </span></li><li><span>
Model based methods use metric information like pupil location, iris and such to calculate or
learn the gaze angle. [1] Use estimated head pose and a head coordinate system along with pupil
location to determine gaze angle. They do eyeball center coordination for the gaze angle relationship
calculation. Their results are good with average error ranging below 10 degrees. Their methodology
is dependent on pupil tracking algorithm which needs better picture quality to detect the pupil.
Their proposed method is simple but it is not robust to low image quality and illumination changes.
The authors also do not account for occlusion since their method depends on the detect-ability of
the pupil. In general [1] represents the model based approach in the best capability. Since it is on
the earlier era of gaze estimation where complex architectures were not being used for this problem
statement, it is evident that a more robust approach to gaze estimation was needed.
                                    </span></li><li><span>
[2] was one of the firsts to use a full face appearance to regress gaze angle (2D and 3D). They use
a Spatial weights convolution neural network which learns specific regions. Some regions like the
back of the head are ignored whereas the eye region that contributes the most is emphasized. They
do an analysis on facial regionsâ€™ contribution to performance comparing two eyes and the proposed
full-face model. In conclusion they achieve overall accuracy improvement of 14.3% and 27.7% for
person-independent 3D gaze estimation on the benchmarks like MPIIGaze and EYEDIAP datasets.
For 2D gaze estimation, The centroid of the six face landmarks was used as the center of the face
and bounding box was estimated. The loss function minimized the distance between the ground
truth and estimation. MPIIGaze generic 3D face model was used to estimate the 3D headpose. For
the 3D model, the loss function is the distance between the predicted and ground-truth gaze angle.
They do achieve an improvement of 7.2% in 2D estimation and 14.3% on 3D estimation over the
baselines introduced. [2] is also more robust to facial appearance variation caused by extreme head
pose and gaze directions as well as illumination. Their method aims to help many problems that
use an appearance based methodology.
                                    </span></li><li><span>
Appearance-based methods work with eye/face images or image based features instead of using
dedicated devices. Appearance based methods would regress the images to an angle or classify a
gaze zone. These methods assume that the features when a driver is looking somehow maps to the
gaze positions. [3] Dgaze takes features like eye, face, head pose and face area in order to regress to
a 2D coordinate of where the driver is looking. They correlate the driver view with another view
plane where their gaze is fixated on. This makes it easier to correlate the front view and identify
the vehicles that the driver might be fixating on. Their ablation study to determine which features
give the highest accuracy leads to them choosing Left eye, face area and headpose. Their late fusion
neural network works well to integrate the information from all the features, beating benchmarks
like MPIIGAZE in terms of error rate(186.89 pixels). Dgaze distinguishes itself from other gaze
estimation methods by producing the gaze point on another plane/view which makes it very easy
to visualize what the driver is looking at.
                                    </span></li><li><span>
In a given road view there are many objects present that are not important to the driver. [4]
worked into incorporating the context of driver gaze in order to get better predictions. The local
and global context is concatenated with 4 fully connected layers along with the ego carâ€™s future path
to determine the important road users. To resolve imbalance in their data, they use a weighted
approach in their model. Usually, neural networks perform better at finding relationships between
the data. In [4] case, using a path vector as a feature did not perform well. They also note that
their performance was affected by the distance between the ego vehicle and prediction. Overall,
they were successful in predicting important road users by context(F1 score 0.59) Rather than
appearance baseline(F1 score 0.53). The applications of [4] makes them stand out from other gaze
estimation methods. Since their importance is subjective and changes from driver to driver; A
context based system would learn a driverâ€™s behavior in a better sense.
                                    </span></li><li><span>
Appearance based methods also involve methods that classify the gaze into labeled image zones
rather than regressing it to an angle. [5] is one of the methods that achieves a higher accuracy
in this task while also working on generalizing the methodology. Driver gaze zone estimation uses
features like driver face which can cause the model to learn driver specific information. Deep
learning models are notorious for finding and learning certain patterns that might backfire.[5]
makes their model more generalized by using just cropped images instead of a full face crop. This
is corroborated by their comparison study between using eye crop, face crop and face + context.
They also compare Alexnet and VGG in terms of architecture for gaze zone classification. VGG
with restricted context (eye crop) gives the best and comparable accuracy in terms with the driver
gaze zone methods (93%). Since, skin and other context information would still be learnt by the
model- there could be a pre-processing step to maybe improve the features. [5] showcased cross
driver study to examine generalization proves to be an important factor for any trained model.
Transformers are always used in state of the art NLP tasks. However, vision transformer
was introduced recently and have been achieving great results in many fields of computer vision.
With transformers being the new CNNs, they are also gaining traction in gaze estimation. Facial
appearance is affected by environmental factors and personal choices (sunglasses and other items of
occlusion). Here, transformers can help my incorporating global information. [6] Uses the popular
ViT architecture for gaze estimation. Since image patching or using a pure transformer architecture
could be contradictory to capturing detailed context, hybrid architecture is also popular. Using
CNN for preprocessing and then using transformer architecture to capture global context. [6] uses
both pure and hybrid approaches. For the hybrid approach, classic ResNet architecture is used.
It is a known fact that vision transformers in general need a lot of data to perform well. Usually,
pre training is applied to achieve a good accuracy. Here, hybrid transformer outperforms state
of the art methods in gaze estimation with pre-training. Ablation study for self attention and
deep convolution study is very interesting. Self attention which is generally used in a transformer
architecture increases the performance when applied to hybrid in [6]. However, deep convolution
which improves CNN performance degrades the performance of the proposed network. It is clear
that transformers when integrated with CNNs are better at capturing the information as they learn
both local and global features.
                                    </span></li><li><span>
Overall we can see a trend in this review that the gaze estimation methods go from a geometric
model based approach to zone classification/angle estimation with deep learning and ultimately
transformers. With all of the new methods coming into place that significantly improves on the
previous works. It is evident that the gaze estimation research is ever growing and there is still a
lot of need for robust models but moreover, there is a need for models that use the gaze estimation
tasks for driver safety issues. Combining gaze estimation with driver road view and correlating
both events will give us information to help with driver and ego vehicle tasks.
